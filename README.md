This program is designed to quiz the user on arithmetic. It does so by asking them to evaluate randomly generated expressions. The functionality to evaluate expressions is based on the [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14472680/how-to-get-and-evaluate-the-expressions-from-a-string-in-c) post my Steve Summit.
